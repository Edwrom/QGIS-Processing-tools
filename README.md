QGIS Processing Tool Collection
===============================

This collection of Processing (formerly Sextante) tools is first structured by Processing version, 
then by topic, then by subfolders.

Some tools depend on scipy. If you use the OSGeo4W installer, install python-scipy from the lib section in Advanced installation.

To install tools developed for Processing 1.1 and QGIS 2.0, copy them into

```
.qgis2/processing/models
.qgis2/processing/scripts
```


To install the tools developed for Sextante 1.0.8 and QGIS 1.8, copy them into the appropriate Sextante subfolders which you can find in 

```
~/.qgis/sextante/models
~/.qgis/sextante/scripts
~/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/ftools
```
