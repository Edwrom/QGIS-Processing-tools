QGIS Processing Tool Collection
===============================

This collection of Processing (formerly Sextante) tools is first structured by Processing version, 
then by topic, then by subfolders.

To install the tools developed for Sextante 1.0.8 and QGIS 1.8, copy them into the appropriate Sextante subfolders which you can find in 

```
~/.qgis/sextante/models
~/.qgis/sextante/scripts
~/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/ftools
```
